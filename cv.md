*More than a year ago, I became passionate about frontend development and decided to change my profession. I love layout, I'm building up my knowledge of JavaScript and ReactJS.*  
*What attracts me to IT is the ability to think systematically and structurally. I am fascinated by the creative component of frontend development, which is the combination of visual appeal and user interface usability.*
